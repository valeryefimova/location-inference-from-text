# Automatic location prediction from text description

This repository describes the structure of the models in order to determine the most appropriate location from the text.
These models are described in detail in the paper [Inferring Image Background from Text Description](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23372-2_1).
